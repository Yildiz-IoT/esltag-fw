# Cursor Session Resume Information

**Project:** Refactoring the ESL Tag Firmware (nrf-esl-bluetooth)

**Workspace Root:** /p:/YILDIZIoT/SmartProducts/ElectronicShelfLabel/TAG/fw/nrf-esl-bluetooth

**Current Status:**
*   Initiated a project refactor within the `organized/` directory.
*   Created a Project Requirements Document (PRD) at `organized/PRD.md`.
*   Committed all changes to the local `main` branch.
*   Pushed the `main` branch to the remote repository `origin`.
*   Updated the `origin` remote URL to `https://github.com/Yildiz-IoT/esltag-fw.git`.
*   The Git working directory should be clean, and the local `main` branch should be up-to-date with the remote.

**Project Plan:**
*   The detailed plan and progress are tracked in `organized/PRD.md`.

**Next Step (According to PRD):**
*   Set up the basic Zephyr project structure by creating initial versions of:
    *   `organized/CMakeLists.txt`
    *   `organized/Kconfig`

**To Resume:**
1.  Ensure the workspace is synced with the remote Git repository (`git pull origin main` if necessary).
2.  Review the `organized/PRD.md` file.
3.  Proceed with creating the `organized/CMakeLists.txt` and `organized/Kconfig` files.
