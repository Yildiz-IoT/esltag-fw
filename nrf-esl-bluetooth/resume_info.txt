# Cursor Session Resume Information

**Project:** Refactoring the ESL Tag Firmware (nrf-esl-bluetooth)

**Workspace Root:** /p:/YILDIZIoT/SmartProducts/ElectronicShelfLabel/TAG/fw/nrf-esl-bluetooth
**Current Git Branch:** reorganized

**Current Status:**
*   Project refactor initiated in `organized/` with separate `tag/` and `access_point/` (future) structures.
*   `organized/tag/` directory structure created.
*   Initial `CMakeLists.txt` and `Kconfig` copied to `organized/tag/`.
*   Gathered initial detailed requirements for the tag firmware (JSON updates, lifecycle states) and updated `organized/PRD.md` and the Cursor rule.
*   The Git working directory should be clean on the `reorganized` branch, and this branch should be pushed to remote.
*   All Kconfig, YAML, and DTS/overlay files in the new structure have been reviewed for path/source issues.
*   Only organized/tag/Kconfig needs an rsource path update; all other files are correct and require no changes.
*   No commit or push has been done yet for these changes; awaiting further instructions.

**Project Plan:**
*   The detailed plan and progress are tracked in `organized/PRD.md`.

**Next Step (According to PRD for Tag Firmware):**
*   Create `organized/tag/bluetooth/` module structure and basic files.
    *   This involves creating empty `bluetooth.c`, `bluetooth.h` (or similar) and a `CMakeLists.txt` fragment for this module.

**To Resume:**
1.  Ensure the workspace is on the `reorganized` branch and synced with the remote Git repository (`git pull origin reorganized` if necessary).
2.  Review the `organized/PRD.md` file for the latest plan.
3.  Proceed with creating the basic file structure for the `organized/tag/bluetooth/` module.
